This is pytorch implementation of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04938v2) with minor variations for my deep learning final project course. I used sinusoidal positional embedding as in [Attention Is all You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). 

# Training and Parameters
Add dataset pathes to `params.py`, you can also change parameters in this file. To start training the model, run train function from `training.py`.
